# Using the examples

For those who do not have access to the intended timetable but still wish to try this tool, two example pages have been provided. These are from my own personal timetable, during my final year at Lboro.

To use these, just open one of the files in your favourite browser, then follow the [instructions](../README.md) from step 2.

## Pure HTML (Universal)
You can open these files with any web browser of your choosing.

* [Semester 1 (HTML Only)](./sem1.html)
* [Semester 2 (HTML Only)](./sem2.html)

## Web Archive (Mac Only)
If you're on a Mac, then you'll be able to open the `.webarchive` files instead. These are a bit better as they include styling.

* [Semester 1 (Full)](./sem1-full.webarchive)
* [Semester 2 (Full)](./sem2-full.webarchive)
