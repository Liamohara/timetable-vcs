# Timetable to Calendar
This script allows Loughborough University students to easily import all lectures as events into a calendar.

## How Do I Use It?
It's quite easy really and it should take **less than a minute to complete**.

1. Open [your timetable](https://lucas.lboro.ac.uk/its_apx/f?p=250) and set the `Period` dropdown box as "Semester 1" or "Semester 2".
2. Open the [browser's console](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/232313848-How-to-open-the-developer-console).
3. Copy and paste the [entire script](/script.js) in and hit enter to execute.
4. Your browser should automatically download the generated `lectures.vcs` file.
5. Open this file with your calendar program (such as Outlook or Calendar.app).
6. Seek help from your nearest Computer Science student in case of failure.

## For The Nerds
So the normies don't get scared off, the [documentation for nerds](/NERDS.md) is separate.
