# timetable-vcs
This script allows Loughborough University students to easily import all lectures as events into a calendar.

## How Does it Work?
1. Open your timetable and set the `Period` dropdown box as "Semester #".
2. Open the browsers console, paste this entire script and hit enter.
3. Your browser should automatically download the generated `lectures.vcs` file.
4. Open this file with your calendar program (such as Outlook or Calendar.app).
5. Seek help from your nearest Computer Science student in case of failure.
